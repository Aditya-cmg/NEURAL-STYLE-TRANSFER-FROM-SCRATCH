# NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER-FROM-SCRATCH
implements the algorithm of neural style transfer using core numpy and tensorflow as stated in research paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style by LEON GATYS

I have tried to minimize use of high level library such as keras and make the mechanisms and math clear for everyone

i will not upload pre-trained VGG-19 matlab file as its over 565+MB but can be downloaded directly through net
